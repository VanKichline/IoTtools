Part 1 from notes -- RPi was not running yet;

Set up Raspian from noobs w/ network attached.
Selected 512 MB data partition + raspian to see what I get.

raspi-config:
Fist, go to 8 (Advanced) and select A0: update to latest version
2: change user password for pi (do not leave as Raspberry)
4: change lacale:
	I1: uncheck en_GB, check en_US.UTF-8, also select as default locale
	I2: timezone -- I selected Pacific Ocean.  We'll see if this is PST
	I3: difficult; I selected 105 key (intl) PC, default AltGr, no Compose, no ctrl-alt-backspace
5: Enable camera
8: Advanced
	Change hostname (I have multiple RPis)
	enable SSH, SPI, I2C, serail
Finished

Boot to Raspian

Part 2:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo rpi-update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo reboot

Part 3: 

sudo adduser van


# do 'groups pi' and 'groups [new user name]'
# add the missing groups (except pi) to the new user, like:
sudo usermod -a -G adm,dialout,cdrom,sudo,audio,video,plugdev,games,users,netdev,input,spi,i2c,gpio [new user name]

# add uer to sudos
sudo visudo
# copy pi (ctrl-k, ctrl-u, ctrl-u) and change pi to [new user name]

sudo reboot
# log in as new user

Part 4:

# install tightvnc
sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
tightvncserver
# (supply an 8 character password)

##?? How do I configure tightvncserver to start up automaticaly?

# Get some of my repos

git config --global user.name "[user name]"
git config --global user.email [user email]

mkdir work
cd work
git clone https://github.com/vankichline/IoTtools.git

# At this point, it's time to unhook the monitor, keyboard and mouse and connect via ssh
